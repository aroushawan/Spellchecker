the following is a program that takes in a file (english_words.txt)  which is fed to spellchecker.py to create a list of words to check spellings from.
main.py is the main program where you can give any filename from the example text files and the output will show you the line numbers where there is a spelling error and the statistics of how many words were correct and incorrect with a percentage as well.
Usage:
clone the repository
run main.py
enter the name of any of the given examples of .txt files. If you give the wrong filename that is not present the program will ask you to enter a correct file name.
Have fun :)
